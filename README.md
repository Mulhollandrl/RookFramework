# Rook Framework
#### Implemented in Python 3.11.9

### Rules:

### How To Run:

You can use the framework built here in the components, algorithms, and enums files to run your own games, or you can run [main.py](main.py) to have a simulation game run.

### Simulation Game:

The simulation game just involves three players playing the game randomly whilst still following the rules. It will tell you who won and with how many points at the end.

### How To Use Framework:

You just have to define a Game object. The Game object takes in a trump color, starting player ID, and a list of Player objects. You can then run tricks one by one, or play the full game.
